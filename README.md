# IT-Service-Desk-System
Created a totally free and open-source IT help desk system. Tasked in doing this project to solve the problem of having an open-sourced platform that IT management systems can use to host their team. The goal is to make this process easier by developing a system that can be used as a free template for any IT help Desk departments
